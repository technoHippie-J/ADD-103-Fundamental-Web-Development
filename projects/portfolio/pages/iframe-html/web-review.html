    &lt;h4&gt;Sacrifices and Dreams: The Tragic Disconnect in Cyberpunk Edgerunners&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;h5&gt;&lt;u&gt;WARNING&lt;/u&gt;: Spoilers ahead. It is &lt;strong&gt;STRONGLY&lt;/strong&gt; recommended you view the series prior to reading this review.&lt;/h5&gt;

        Cyberpunk Edgerunners is a powerful exploration of the dangers of integrating technology into human biology. At the heart of the series is the relationship between David and Lucy, which provides a deeply emotional core amidst the chaos of Night City. Their bond, though tested by the harsh realities of their world, highlights the enduring strength of human connection.
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The show’s portrayal of cyberpsychosis—a condition where too much integration of technology into one's body drives people to madness—serves as a warning about the risks of losing our humanity as we augment ourselves. David’s journey, marked by his struggle with this condition, shows the thin line between enhancing our abilities and losing our sense of self. Despite the overwhelming odds, David’s final act of sacrifice to save Lucy demonstrates that even in a world dominated by machines, our humanity can prevail.
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        In just 10 episodes, Cyberpunk Edgerunners delivers a gripping narrative that questions the price of technological advancement and reminds us of the importance of preserving what makes us human.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;!--Add a H2 tag describing characters, game play, or some specific part of your review--&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;David and Lucy&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was--&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The relationship between David and Lucy in Cyberpunk Edgerunners is both deeply touching and tragically flawed. Their bond strengthens as they navigate the dangers of Night City, with David taking on Lucy's dream of going to the moon as his own. His love for her is so profound that he sacrifices everything to ensure she can achieve this dream. However, as the story progresses, Lucy’s priorities shift—by the end, all she truly wants is for David to live. This disconnect between their desires highlights the tragic nature of their relationship.
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The &lt;b&gt;real&lt;/b&gt; tragedy lies in how their lack of communication leads to David’s ultimate sacrifice. If David had known that Lucy no longer cared about reaching the moon but instead valued their time together, he might have made different choices. Their inability to express their changing feelings and goals creates a gap between them, one that ultimately leads to David’s downfall. In trying to protect Lucy and fulfill what he believes is her dream, David misses the chance to give her what she really wants: a life together.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;!--Add an H3 tag about a scene or character, include a quote in the paragraph--&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;A Sacrifice Misunderstood: David's Final Act of Love&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I ain't worth it Lucy. Besides you, I got nothing left. But you still have a dream to stick around for. I need you to see it through. That's my dream.&quot; &lt;br&gt;- &lt;em&gt;David Martinez&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;div&gt;The tragic moment when David expresses his final thoughts to Lucy is a heart-wrenching culmination of his journey. In his words, there's a deep sense of resignation and sacrifice, as he fully commits to the idea that his own life has lost its value outside of ensuring Lucy’s future. The pain of his realization is palpable—he believes he has nothing left but his love for her, which drives him to make the ultimate sacrifice. This moment encapsulates the devastating irony that while David sees his purpose in helping Lucy achieve her dream, he tragically misunderstands that her dream has shifted to simply wanting him to survive. His noble intention, born out of love, ultimately leads to a poignant and sorrowful conclusion, underscoring the deep emotional cost of their miscommunication.&lt;/div&gt;


    &lt;!-- I came back to this to clean it up a bit, and realized that when inspecting the element in Chrome, I was seeing the paragraph element above the h3 and empty, though it was saved at containing the block quote and div. So I'm guessing one or both of those cannot exit inside a paragraph? I got rid of the paragraph element, so now I have a div. --&gt;

    &lt;!--In the code above add at leas two of the following:
    
    &lt;b&gt; Bold Text &lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt; Important Text &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;em&gt; emphasized text &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;mark&gt; marked text &lt;/mark&gt;
    &lt;small&gt; smaller text&lt;/small&gt;
    &lt;del&gt;Deleted text&lt;/del&gt;
    &lt;ins&gt;Inserted text&lt;/ins&gt;
    &lt;sub&gt;Subscript text&lt;/sub&gt;
    &lt;sup&gt;Superscript text&lt;/sup&gt;
    
    
    --&gt;
