"""
This program prompts the user to input a password and ensures it meets specific criteria:
- Between 8 to 20 characters long.
- Contains at least one uppercase letter.
- Contains at least one lowercase letter.
- Includes at least one number.
- Includes at least one symbol from the set: !@#$%&*.

The program uses a while loop to repeatedly ask for the password until all criteria are met.
Once a valid password is entered, the user is prompted to enter it again for confirmation.
If the second password entry matches the first, a success message is displayed.
Otherwise, the user is prompted to start the process again.

Functions:
- chk_alpha(string): Checks if the password contains at least one letter.
- chk_upper(string): Checks if the password contains at least one uppercase letter.
- chk_lower(string): Checks if the password contains at least one lowercase letter.
- chk_number(string): Checks if the password contains at least one number.
- chk_symbol(string): Checks if the password contains at least one symbol out of an accepted list.
- chk_length(string): Checks if the password complies with minimum and maximum length limitions.

The program also uses try-except blocks to handle any errors or exceptions that occur.

# Assignment Outline:
# Set up your program in a main() function
# Create a Python program that asks the user to input a password.
# Ensure the password meets the following criteria:
# Between 8 to 20 characters long.
# Contains at least one uppercase letter.
# Contains at least one lowercase letter.
# Includes at least one number.
# Includes at least one symbol from the set: !@  # $%&*.
# Use a while loop to keep asking for the password until all criteria are met.
# Once a valid password is entered, prompt the user to enter it again for confirmation.
# Use try -except blocks to handle any errors or exceptions that occur.
# If the second password entry matches the first, display a success message. Otherwise, prompt the user to start the process again.
