# assignment budget breakdown calculator
# this program will calculate the budget breakdown for a
# given a set of monthly expenditures

# Requirements:
#  Design a Python program that prompts users to enter their total budget and amounts for different spending categories
#   Housing(rent or mortgage)
#   Utilities
#   Groceries
#   Transportation
#   Health Care
#   Personal Care
#   Clothing
#   Debt
#   Calculate the percentage of the total budget spent in each category.
#   Display the results in a user-friendly format, clearly showing the budget breakdown. (use f strings)
#   Ensure your code is well-commented to explain the functionality of different sections.

# variables - the numberical variables used by the program and
#    their initial states should be defined at the top of the
#    program.
