# Objective: Develop a program to manage ticket sales for an event.

# Context: You are in charge of ticket sales for a special event. The venue has 20 seats, each uniquely numbered from 1 to 20. Your task is to create a system that tracks and updates the availability of seats as they are sold.

# Assignment Steps:


# Initialize the Seating List:

# Create a list in your program representing the 20 seats. This list should initially include all seat numbers(1-20).
# Display Available Seats:

# Write code to display the list of available seats to the customer. This list should update as seats are sold.
# Implement the Ticket Purchase Process:

# Prompt the customer to select a seat by entering its number.
# Include instructions in your prompt, indicating that the customer should enter '0' to finish their purchase.
# Update Seat Availability:

# Once a seat is selected, remove it from the list of available seats.
# After each selection, display the updated list of available seats.
# Continue this process until the customer enters '0', indicating they are done buying tickets.
# Ensure User-Friendly Interaction:

# Your program should handle inputs gracefully. If a customer selects a seat that doesn't exist or is already sold, display a friendly message and prompt them to choose again.
# Test Your Program:

# Run your program to ensure it works as expected. Try different scenarios, such as selling all seats, selling a few seats, and entering invalid seat numbers.

# I think I can use lists to save users then
# check if they exist so that the program
# can remember users and their purchases.
# Attempt after completing nested list assignment.

# keeps the loop going until the user has indicated they are finished or when there are still seats available for purchase.
