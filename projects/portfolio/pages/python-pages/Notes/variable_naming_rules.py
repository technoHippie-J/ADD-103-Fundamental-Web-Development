# composed of letters (upper or lower case), digits, and underscores (_)
# Must start with a letter or an underscore(_)
# Case-sensitive ('myVar' and 'myvar' are different)
# Cannot be a Python reserved word

# Correct: my_variable, age_1, Name123 (this last one is unacceptable in class)
# Incorrect: 123name, $price, my-variable

# Creating and using Variable in Python:
# Use the assignment operator (=) with a variable name and value
# my_variable = 42
# A comparator would be the following (==)

# Assigning new values to variables
# easily overwrite existing values
# my_variable = 42   original
# my_variable = 7    new/replacement

# Formatting numbers
# formatting numbers stored in variables makes it easier for readers to understand
# using variables in this manner enhances the readability of python code
# additionally, it streamlines the presentation of data

# print() function outputs text
# f-string (f"") allows for string formatting
