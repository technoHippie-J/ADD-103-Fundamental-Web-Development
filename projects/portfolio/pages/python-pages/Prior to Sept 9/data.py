# the following program was an in-class example written
# while Meri demonstrated the same. As far as I can tell,
# this is not an assignment that needs to be turned in

# example data types

# variables should describe contents

# creates the variable "x" and stores the number "2"
x = 2

# creates the variable "y" and stores the string "2"
y = "2"

# prints to screen both variables, displaying the
# number "2" and the string "2"
print(x, y)

# prints to screen the results of the mathematical
# equation because remember, the variable "x" contains
# the number "2" which can be used in equations
print(x + x)

# prints to screen the one string after the other
print(y + y)

# using the "str" function converts the variable "x"
# into a string, which allows "x" and "y" to be
# combined as in the example above
print(str(x) + y)

# the following are examples of boolean data types
tired = True
caffeinated = False

# prints the variable, which contains the results
# of the boolean, which is True in this case
print(tired)

# prints the string followed by the variable
print("Is Meri tired?", tired)
