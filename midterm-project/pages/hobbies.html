                            I'm focused on 3D printing again after 6-8 months of inactivity, and motivation is building. Lately, I’ve been printing small items to improve daily life, like minimalist wallets and pull-out drawers for my adjustable desk. I got a great deal on motorized table legs and used a 60”x30” pine sheet as the tabletop. Since it’s a semi-DIY project, I’m adding 3D-printed drawers underneath. The more drawer space I print, the less clutter on my desk. Designing these practical items is a fun way to mix creativity with functionality.

                            I struggle to maintain hobbies, often hyper-focusing on one or two for a few months before getting bored and moving on. Some hobbies rotate back, but this leaves behind unfinished projects and unused equipment. Still, they aren't time-wasters. As I’ve grown older, I focus more on self-improvement than entertainment, with most of my hyper-focuses aimed at personal growth or quality-of-life upgrades. The issue is these phases don’t last, and slipping back into bad habits after months of effort can be draining, impacting my mood, energy, and motivation.

                            I’m hoping to get serious about my health again, though it’s not my current focus. Keto and carnivore diets have greatly improved my medical issues—keto helps, and carnivore works wonders. When I first did keto, I lost 30 lbs in a month, hit 180 lbs, reduced symptoms, and had more energy than ever. I stayed hyper-focused for a year, learning a lot about metabolism, inflammation, and mental health. Without that focus, it’s been harder to stay strict, so I’m revisiting YouTube channels to reignite it. These diets also push me to cook from scratch, improving my quality of life.
