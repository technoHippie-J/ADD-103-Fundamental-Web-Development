                        Currently, I'm hyper-focused on 3D printing. After 6-8 months of inactivity, I feel the focus building again. I'm printing things to improve my quality of life in small ways, like minimalist wallet designs and pull-out drawers to mount under my adjustable desk. I got a good deal on motorized table legs without a tabletop and used a 60”x30”x1.25” pine sheet from Menards. Since it's semi-DIY, I figured I'd add 3D-printed drawers underneath. The more drawer space I have, the less clutter on the desk itself!

                        It’s difficult for me to maintain hobbies. I tend to hyper-focus on one or two things, dedicating most of my time to them for 6 weeks to 4 months before getting bored and moving on, though some rotate back once or twice a year. This results in half-finished projects, unused parts, and multiple sets of beginner equipment for various interests. That isn’t to say my hobbies are time-wasters. As I've gotten older, I focus more on self-improvement rather than entertainment. Most of my hyper-focuses now involve self-improvement or quality of life upgrades. The problem is, like before, these things don't last, and returning to bad habits after months of effort can be painful, turning what was tolerable before into a major drain on mood, energy, and motivation.

                        Though it's not a current hyper-focus, I'm hoping to get serious about my health again. I have medical issues greatly improved by restrictive diets—keto helps a lot and carnivore works like magic—and I've been strict with them before. The first time I did keto, I lost 30 lbs in a month, returned to 180 lbs in a couple of months, saw huge symptom reductions, and felt more energetic than since childhood. I was hyper-focused on it for a year and learned a lot about metabolism, inflammatory diseases, blood sugar, and mental illness. Without that hyper-focus, I've struggled to maintain the restrictions. So I'm revisiting YouTube channels to trigger the hyper-focus again. Another benefit is these diets motivate me to experiment with recipes for variety. On a standard diet, it's easy to grab frozen pizza or eat out, but on keto and carnivore, that's not an option. Everything is made from scratch with fresh ingredients, greatly improving quality of life.
