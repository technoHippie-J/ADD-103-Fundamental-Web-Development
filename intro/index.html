    <h1>Tony's Introduction</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="images/pfp.png" width="233">
        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>My name is Tony Janus. I'm 37 and this is my second attempt
                here at MCC, linked below. I'm working towards the Software Application 
                Development and Design degree, which I'm planning to complete at the end of the
                spring semester of the 2025-26 school year. I'm looking to focus on
                iOS development, and hope to obtain employment after graduation while
                working towards a 4-year degree. 
            </p>
            <a href="https://mchenry.edu/">Mchenry County College</a>
            <p>I am taking the Fundamental Web Development class for three reasons. The first being
                that it is a requirement for my degree, the second that I enjoyed the web design
                classes during my previous enrollment here at MCC, and the third being that it is
                taught by Meri, I'm not sure how many opportunities I'll have to take classes
                with her over the next couple years, and I very much enjoy having her as an instructor.
            </p>
        <h3>How do I spend my free time?</h3>
            <p>Well, recently I haven't had much free time. Over the past 3 weeks or so,
                I've been busy with medical appointments, court drama, work around the
                house, and preparing to return to school. In the last week in particular,
                I feel like I've had no time to myself and spent all weekend catching up
                with school work, which I fell a little behind on due to family/court
                circumstances and obtaining/preparing the tools and tech I need to make
                my school enrollment successful.
            <br>
            <br>
                When I do have some free time, I like to spend it with my dog, preparing
                food for my fairly restrictive diet (carnivore), and gardening. I used to
                enjoy playing video games, but I haven't had much time to involve myself
                in them like I once did. I do however play a mobile gatcha game, Honkai Star Rail.
                I've never considered mobile games to be on par with console and PC gaming,
                and while modern mobile games resemble their traditional counterparts more than ever,
                my mind just cannot view them as the same. This is likely because of the way many of
                these games use an energy system to limit how much the player can do in a 
                given amount of time. So ultimately, it doesn't actually take up much of my time,
                and given the time restrictions placed on me, my mind doesn't see it as "gaming". 
                It serves as a nice distraction when I need to let my brain decompress. The 
                image below is the official art release for the latest patch, 2.4. It is a 
                turn-based RPG with a heavy focus on team building. It's developed by
                MiHoYo, the same company responsible for Genshin Impact (which I could never
                get into.)

                Each character has two combat abilities: a basic attack and a skill, plus an ultimate,
                as well as a talent which triggers after certain actions in combat, and 
                traces (like talent trees in other games) which all combine to create a unique playstyle
                for each character. The game focuses on team building, which also serves to 
                entice players into spending their money on the gatcha system. However, it's fairly
                generous when played as a free-to-play game, and through completing the 
                story, side-quests, and events, a player can accumulate the resources to 
                ensure a well-built team after a few months, and two teams capable of 
                completing end-game content within 4-6 months or less, especially if the player
                plans out their resources efficiently.

    <h2>About My Dog</h2>
        <h3>Ripley</h3>
        <img src="images/ripley.jpg" width="229">
            <p>This is Ripley. She's a husky and around 5 years old as best as I can tell, but she
                came from a rescue shelter, so they weren't sure if she was 2 or 3 at the time. She's surpringly
                lethargic for a husky, spending much of her day sleeping. When she's not sleeping, 
                she's either begging for treats or staring at me while I'm cleaning or preparing food.
                I try to take her for walks at least every other day, but over the last few weeks, 
                I've been too busy to do so. She has not been happy with me, but hopefully now that 
                most obligations have been dealt with, I'll have the time to starting taking her for 
                walks again. We both need the exercise desperately, lol! She's named after Ellen Ripley
                from the Alien franchise, which I think is one of the best sci-fi/horror franchises in cinema.
