Create a holiday-themed webpage that showcases your ability to apply HTML 
  and CSS best practices. Choose a holiday (Valentine's Day, Christmas, 
  Halloween, Fourth of July, etc.) and design a webpage that reflects the 
  holiday's spirit, colors, and traditions.

Objective:
Reinforce the HTML and CSS style guide rules by creating a visually appealing 
  and structurally sound webpage.

Requirements:
 - Properly declare the document type and use lowercase for element 
    and attribute names.
 - Close all HTML elements and quote attribute values.

    <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="../favicon.ico">
 - Include essential tags like <html>, <body>, <title>, and <meta>.
 - Link to an external CSS file for styles.
 - Your page must have at least 3 images, 250 words of content, 
    and utilize at least 3 different heading types.
 - **Extra Credit** Use classes and divs to structure your page, 
    including a container class for the main content area.

 HTML and CSS Style Guide:
 - Always specify alt, width, and height attributes for images.
 - Use indentation and blank lines for code readability.
 - Include the lang attribute and character encoding.
 - Ensure your webpage is responsive by setting the viewport.
 - Use comments to organize your code.

Your submission will be graded on adherence to the project requirements, 
  code quality, creativity, and how well your webpage reflects the chosen 
  holiday theme.
